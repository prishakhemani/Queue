# Queue
# THEORY
The queue is a basic data structure just like a stack. In contrast to stack that uses the LIFO approach, queue uses the FIFO (first in, first out) approach. With this approach, the first item that is added to the queue is the first item to be removed from the queue. Just like Stack, the queue is also a linear data structure.

In a real-world analogy, we can imagine a bus queue where the passengers wait for the bus in a queue or a line. The first passenger in the line enters the bus first as that passenger happens to be the one who had come first.
